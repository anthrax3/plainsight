Description
-----------
The goal of Plainsight is to help you avoid being flagged as 'suspicious' by
internet censors. By using Plainsight, your data will be enciphered to look
like harmless English prose. When you transmit it to someone else, eaves-
droppers will only see the written word, and not your data payload.

This is an improvement over just sending an encrypted file, because no
suspicious random-looking bitstreams are seen by others.


How to use
----------

1. Install it (only Python 2 is supported at this time, due to the path in the executable shim):

        sudo pip install bitstring
        sudo pip install plainsight

2. Download a copy of 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'

        curl -o sherlock.txt http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1661/pg1661.txt

3. Type your message to encode:

        echo 'Meet at Union Square at noon. The password is FuriousGreen.' > cleartext

4. Then, pipe it through Plainsight:

        cat cleartext | plainsight -m encipher -f sherlock.txt > ciphertext

5. The output will be gibberish that Doyle could've written:

        cat ciphertext | fold -s

        which was the case, of a light. And, his hand. "BALLARAT." only applicant?"

6. Now, decipher that ciphertext:

        cat ciphertext | plainsight -m decipher -f sherlock.txt > deciphered

        cat deciphered

        Meet at Union Square at noon. The password is FuriousGreen.


TODO
----
* More entropic ciphertexts.  
    (e.g. play with changing the probability mass as tree depth increases).
* Regression tests (e.g. for EOF).
* Robust adding of files to language model (e.g. independent of args order).
* Model serialization to pickled Python objects.
* Higher throughput.
* Tighter code.
* Support for other languages (e.g. Chinese).
* Port to other languages (e.g. Ruby).


Bugs
----

The implementation is not as clear as it should be.
